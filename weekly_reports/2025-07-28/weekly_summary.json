{"week": "2025-07-28", "summary": "This past week, the market was characterized by a tense calm, with major indexes trading in a very narrow range. This flat price action stood in stark contrast to the exceptionally high VIX, which signaled extreme underlying fear among investors. A notable trend was the clear rotation of capital into specific sectors. Investors strongly favored growth areas like Technology and Industrials while simultaneously selling off defensive sectors such as Consumer Staples. This created opportunities to be selectively bullish on market leaders and bearish on laggards, primarily by selling expensive options premium to profit from the high anxiety. Looking ahead, the key insight is to remain cautious as this period of high fear and low volatility is unlikely to last. The market is positioned for a significant move, and traders should watch for a breakout from the current range to signal the next direction while continuing to favor the strongest sectors.", "dates": ["2025-07-28", "2025-07-29"]}
