{"week": "2025-07-21", "summary": "This past week's trading was defined by a strategically bullish but selective approach, focusing on specific sector strengths and weaknesses. The technology sector was a primary focus, with bullish positions on Adobe, AMD, and Visa aiming to capitalize on strong momentum and high implied volatility ahead of key catalysts. This positive outlook extended to defense with Lockheed Martin and healthcare with UnitedHealth Group, both driven by strong fundamental news.\n\nConversely, we adopted a bearish stance on industrials and retail, targeting weakness in Caterpillar and Target due to macro data and pre-earnings uncertainty. A neutral, range-bound strategy was implemented for JPMorgan to navigate its consolidation phase. A notable trend across the portfolio was the deliberate selling of premium to take advantage of elevated implied volatility in several names.\n\nFor the coming week, the main actionable insight is to closely monitor our open positions against their management rules. We must watch for the AMD earnings announcement on July 29th, as it is the most immediate catalyst. It is critical to be prepared to manage any trades approaching their risk triggers, such as the short-leg delta threshold, or their pre-defined profit targets.", "dates": ["2025-07-21"]}
